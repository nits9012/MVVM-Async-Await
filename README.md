# MVVM-Async-Await

I am using a GET API for this demo, which is sourced from https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com. The API endpoint is: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users.

When you run the app, it will fetch the list of contacts asynchronously using async/await. The ViewModel handles fetching and error handling, and the UI is updated reactively through SwiftUI's declarative approach.

In this example, I follow the MVVM design pattern, which separates concerns between data, logic, and UI. The async/await pattern ensures the app remains responsive by managing asynchronous tasks in a clean and efficient manner.

Hope this helps you understand how async/await can be used.
